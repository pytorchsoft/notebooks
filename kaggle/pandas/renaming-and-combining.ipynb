For example, to change the `points` column in our dataset to `score`, we would do:"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true},"outputs":[],"source":"\nimport pandas as pd\npd.set_option('display.max_rows', 5)\nreviews = pd.read_csv(\"../input/wine-reviews/winemag-data-130k-v2.csv\", index_col=0)"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"collapsed":true},"outputs":[],"source":"reviews.rename(columns={'points': 'score'})"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":"`rename()` lets you rename index _or_ column values by specifying a `index` or `column` keyword parameter, respectively. It supports a variety of input formats, but usually a Python dictionary is the most convenient.

For that, `set_index()` is usually more convenient.\n\nBoth the row index and the column index can have their own `name` attribute. The complimentary `rename_axis()` method may be used to change these names. For example:"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"collapsed":true},"outputs":[],"source":"reviews.rename_axis(\"wines\", axis='rows').rename_axis(\"fields\", axis='columns')"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":"# Combining\n\nWhen performing operations on a dataset, we will sometimes need to combine different DataFrames and/or Series in non-trivial ways. Pandas has three core methods for doing this. In order of increasing complexity, these are `concat()`, `join()`, and `merge()`. Most of what `merge()` can do can also be done more simply with `join()`, so we will omit it and focus on the first two functions here.\n\nThe simplest combining method is `concat()`. Given a list of elements, this function will smush those elements together along an axis.\n\nThis is useful when we have data in different DataFrame or Series objects but having the same fields (columns). One example: the [YouTube Videos dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/youtube-new), which splits the data up based on country of origin (e.g. Canada and the UK, in this example). If we want to study multiple countries simultaneously, we can use `concat()` to smush them together:"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"collapsed":true},"outputs":[],"source":"canadian_youtube = pd.read_csv(\"../input/youtube-new/CAvideos.csv\")\nbritish_youtube = pd.read_csv(\"../input/youtube-new/GBvideos.csv\")\n\npd.concat([canadian_youtube, british_youtube])"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":"The middlemost combiner in terms of complexity is `join()`. `join()` lets you combine different DataFrame objects which have an index in common. For example, to pull down videos that happened to be trending on the same day in _both_ Canada and the UK, we could do the following:"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"collapsed":true},"outputs":[],"source":"left = canadian_youtube.set_index(['title', 'trending_date'])\nright = british_youtube.set_index(['title', 'trending_date'])\n\nleft.join(right, lsuffix='_CAN', rsuffix='_UK')"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":"The `lsuffix` and `rsuffix` parameters are necessary here because the data has the same column names in both British and Canadian datasets. If this wasn't true (because, say, we'd renamed them beforehand) we wouldn't need them.\n\n# Your turn\n\nIf you haven't started the exercise, you can **[get started here](https://www.kaggle.com/kernels/fork/638064)**."},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":"---\n\n\n\n\n*Have questions or comments?
