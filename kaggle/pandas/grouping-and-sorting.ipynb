{"cells":[{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":"# Introduction\n\nMaps allow us to transform data in a DataFrame or Series one value at a time for an entire column. However, often we want to group our data, and then do something specific to the group the data is in. \n\nAs you'll learn, we do this with the `groupby()` operation.  We'll also cover some additional topics, such as more complex ways to index your DataFrames, along with how to sort your data.\n\n**To start the exercise for this topic, please click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/kernels/fork/598715).**\n\n# Groupwise analysis\n\nOne function we've been using heavily thus far is the `value_counts()` function.

Then, for each of these groups, we grabbed the `points()` column and counted how many times it appeared.  `value_counts()` is just a shortcut to this `groupby()` operation. \n\nWe can use any of the summary functions we've used before with this data. For example, to get the cheapest wine in each point value category, we can do the following:"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"scrolled":true},"outputs":[],"source":"reviews.groupby('points').price.min()"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":"You can think of each group we generate as being a slice of our DataFrame containing only data with values that match.
