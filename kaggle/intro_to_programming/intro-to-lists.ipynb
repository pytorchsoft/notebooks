Python has many data structures available for holding your data, such as lists, sets, dictionaries, and tuples.  In this tutorial, you will learn how to work with Python lists.\n\n# Motivation\n\nIn the [Petal to the Metal competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/tpu-getting-started), your goal is to classify the species of a flower based only on its image.  (This is a common task in computer vision, and it is called image classification.)  Towards this goal, say you organize the names of the flower species in the data.  \n\nOne way to do this is by organizing the names in a Python string."},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2022-03-24T21:31:51.044889Z","iopub.status.busy":"2022-03-24T21:31:51.044498Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-03-24T21:31:51.050057Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-03-24T21:31:51.049088Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-03-24T21:31:51.044768Z"}},"outputs":[],"source":"flowers = \"pink primrose,hard-leaved pocket orchid,canterbury bells,sweet pea,english marigold,tiger lily,moon orchid,bird of paradise,monkshood,globe thistle\"\n\nprint(type(flowers))\nprint(flowers)"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":"Even better is to represent the same data in a Python list.
