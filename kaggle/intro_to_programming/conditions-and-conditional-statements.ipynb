{"cells":[{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":"# Introduction\n\nYou have already seen that when you change the input value to a function, you often get a different output.  For instance, consider an `add_five()` function that just adds five to any number and returns the result.  Then `add_five(7)` will return an output of 12 (=7+5), and `add_five(8)` will return an output of 13 (=8+5).  Note that no matter what the input is, the action that the function performs is always the same: it always adds five.\n\nBut you might instead need a function that performs an action that depends on the input.  For instance, you might need a function `add_three_or_eight()` that adds three if the input is less than 10, and adds eight if the input is 10 or more.  Then `add_three_or_eight(1)` will return 4 (= 1+3), but `add_three_or_eight(11)` will return 19 (=11+8).  In this case, the action that the function performs varies with the input.\n\nIn this lesson, you will learn how to use conditions and conditional statements to modify how your functions run.\n\n# Conditions\n\nIn programming, **conditions** are statements that are either `True` or `False`.  There are many different ways to write conditions in Python, but some of the most common ways of writing conditions just compare two different values.  For instance, you can check if 2 is greater than 3."},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2022-03-14T18:49:02.822463Z","iopub.status.busy":"2022-03-14T18:49:02.822109Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-03-14T18:49:02.854066Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-03-14T18:49:02.853294Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-03-14T18:49:02.822378Z"}},"outputs":[],"source":"print(2 > 3)"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":"Python identifies this as False, since 2 is not greater than 3.\n\nYou can also use conditions to compare the values of variables.
