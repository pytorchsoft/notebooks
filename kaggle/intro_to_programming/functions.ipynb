The **argument** is the name of the variable that will be used as input to the function. It is always enclosed in parentheses that apppear immediately after the name of the function.  (_Note that a function can also have no arguments, or it can have multiple arguments.  You'll see some examples of this later in the lesson._)  \n- For every function, the parentheses enclosing the function argument(s) must be followed by a colon `:`.\n \n## Body\nThe function **body** specifies the work that the function does.\n- Every line of code in the function body must be indented exactly four spaces.  You can do this by pushing the space bar four times, or by hitting the \"Tab\" button once on your keyboard.  (_As you learn more about Python, you may need to indent your code by more than four spaces, but you'll learn more about that later in this course._)\n- The function does its work by running all of the indented lines from top to bottom.  \n    - It takes the argument as input, which in the example is `input_var`.  \n    - The function creates a new variable `output_var` with the calculation `output_var = input_var + 3`.\n    - Then, the final line of code, called the **return statement**, just returns the value in `output_var` as the function's output.\n  \nThe code cell above just defines the function, but does not run it.  The details of the function body will make more sense after the next code cell, when we actually run the function.\n\n# How to run (or \"call\") a function\n \nWhen we run a function, it can also be referred to as \"calling\" the function.\n\nIn the code cell below, we run the function with `10` as the input value.  We define a new variable `new_number` which is set to the output of the function."},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"cddc3071","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2022-03-08T19:56:59.192082Z","iopub.status.busy":"2022-03-08T19:56:59.191464Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-03-08T19:56:59.194072Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-03-08T19:56:59.194568Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-02-15T20:26:36.955602Z"},"papermill":{"duration":0.022884,"end_time":"2022-03-08T19:56:59.194726","exception":false,"start_time":"2022-03-08T19:56:59.171842","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[],"source":"# Run the function with 10 as input\nnew_number = add_three(10)\n\n# Check that the value is 13, as expected\nprint(new_number)"},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"9a15d398","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.015508,"end_time":"2022-03-08T19:56:59.226208","exception":false,"start_time":"2022-03-08T19:56:59.2107","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":"![](https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/learn/images/hlUbxQE.png)\n\nIn more detail,\n- `add_three(10)` is the value that we get as output when we supply `10` as the value for `input_var` and call the `add_three()` function.  When the function runs, it runs all of the code in its body, from top to bottom:\n  - It first calculates `output_var = input_var + 3`, which sets `output_var = 13`.  \n  - The final line of code is the return statement, which returns the value of `output_var`, which is `13`.\n- By setting `new_number = add_three(10)`, we set `new_number = 13`. \n\n**Note**: When we casually refer to the `add_three()` function in this tutorial, we use empty closing parentheses after the function name.  This is consistent with how people generally write explanations of Python code, and the empty parentheses just make it clear that we are referring to a function, as opposed to a variable or another Python object.  These parentheses should always be empty, even if the function has arguments.\n\n# Naming functions\n\nIn the example above, the name of the function was selected for you.  When naming your own functions, you should use only lowercase letters, with words separated by underscores instead of spaces.\n\nNaming functions will feel natural over time, and it is normal for it to feel uncomfortable at first.  The best way to learn is by viewing a lot of Python code."},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"d283049c","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.015316,"end_time":"2022-03-08T19:56:59.25691","exception":false,"start_time":"2022-03-08T19:56:59.241594","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":"# A more complex example\n\nNow that you understand the basics, we can move on to an example with a longer calculation.\n\nSay you are helping a friend to calculate their weekly paycheck after taxes. \n- They're in a 12% tax bracket (in other words, 12% of their salary is taken for taxes, and they only take home 88%), and \n- They're paid hourly, at a rate of $15/hour.\n\nThe function below calculates the paycheck based on the number of hours worked.
