{"cells":[{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":"Now that you can create your own line charts, it's time to learn about more chart types!  \n\n> By the way, if this is your first experience with writing code in Python, you should be _very proud_ of all that you have accomplished so far, because it's never easy to learn a completely new skill!  If you stick with the course, you'll notice that everything will only get easier (while the charts you'll build will get more impressive!), since the code is pretty similar for all of the charts.  Like any skill, coding becomes natural over time, and with repetition.\n\nIn this tutorial, you'll learn about **bar charts** and **heatmaps**.\n\n# Set up the notebook\n\nAs always, we begin by setting up the coding environment.

Negative entries denote flights that (_on average_) tended to arrive early.

In this case, we select the `'NK'` column.\n\n> **Important Note**: You must select the indexing column with `flight_data.index`, and it is not possible to use `flight_data['Month']` (_which will return an error_).  This is because when we loaded the dataset, the `\"Month\"` column was used to index the rows.  **We always have to use this special notation to select the indexing column.**\n\n# Heatmap\n\nWe have one more plot type to learn about: **heatmaps**! \n\nIn the code cell below, we create a heatmap to quickly visualize patterns in `flight_data`.

(_Leaving this out removes the numbers from each of the cells!_)\n\n_What patterns can you detect in the table?  For instance, if you look closely, the months toward the end of the year (especially months 9-11) appear relatively dark for all airlines.  This suggests that airlines are better (on average) at keeping schedule during these months!_  \n\n# What's next?\n\nCreate your own visualizations with a **[coding exercise](https://www.kaggle.com/kernels/fork/2951537)**!"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":"---\n\n\n\n\n*Have questions or comments?
