For instance, we use `sns.lineplot` to make line charts.  Soon, you'll learn that we use `sns.barplot` and `sns.heatmap` to make bar charts and heatmaps, respectively._\n- `data=spotify_data` selects the data that will be used to create the chart.\n\nNote that you will always use this same format when you create a line chart, and **_the only thing that changes with a new dataset is the name of the dataset_**.  So, if you were working with a different dataset named `financial_data`, for instance, the line of code would appear as follows:\n```\nsns.lineplot(data=financial_data)\n```\n\nSometimes there are additional details we'd like to modify, like the size of the figure and the title of the chart.

In general, to plot only a single column, we use this format with putting the name of the column in single quotes and enclosing it in square brackets.  (_To make sure that you correctly specify the name of the column, you can print the list of all column names using the command you learned above._)\n- We also add `label=\"Shape of You\"` to make the line appear in the legend and set its corresponding label.\n\nThe final line of code modifies the label for the horizontal axis (or x-axis), where the desired label is placed in quotation marks (`\"...\"`).\n\n# What's next?\n\nPut your new skills to work in a **[coding exercise](https://www.kaggle.com/kernels/fork/3303716)**!"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":"---\n\n\n\n\n*Have questions or comments?
