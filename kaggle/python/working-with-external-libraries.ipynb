Generally, names that follow this double-underscore format have a special meaning to Python.\n\nSo, for example, the expression `x in [1, 2, 3]` is actually calling the list method `__contains__` behind-the-scenes. It's equivalent to (the much uglier) `[1, 2, 3].__contains__(x)`. \n\nIf you're curious to learn more, you can check out [Python's official documentation](https://docs.python.org/3.4/reference/datamodel.html#special-method-names), which describes many, many more of these special \"underscores\" methods.\n\nWe won't be defining our own types in these lessons (if only there was time!), but I hope you'll get to experience the joys of defining your own wonderful, weird types later down the road."},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":"# Your turn!\n\nHead over to **[the final coding exercise](https://www.kaggle.com/kernels/fork/1275190)** for one more round of coding questions involving imports, working with unfamiliar objects, and, of course, more gambling."},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":"---\n\n\n\n\n*Have questions or comments?
