Python is prized for its readability and the simplicity. \n\nNote how we indicated which code belongs to the `if`. `\"But I don't want ANY spam!\"` is only supposed to be printed if `spam_amount` is positive. But the later code (like `print(viking_song)`) should be executed no matter what. How do we (and Python) know that?\n\nThe colon (`:`) at the end of the `if` line indicates that a new **code block** is starting. Subsequent lines which are indented are part of that code block. \n> **Note**: If you've coded before, you might know that some other languages use `{`curly braces`}` to mark the beginning and end of code blocks. Python's use of meaningful whitespace can be surprising to programmers who are accustomed to other languages, but in practice it can lead to more consistent and readable code than languages that do not enforce indentation of code blocks. \n\nThe later lines dealing with `viking_song` are not indented with an extra 4 spaces, so they're not a part of the `if`'s code block. We'll see more examples of indented code blocks later when we define functions and using loops.\n\nThis code snippet is also our first sighting of a **string** in Python:\n\n```python\n\"But I don't want ANY spam!\"\n```\n\nStrings can be marked either by double or single quotation marks.
