{"cells":[{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":"In this tutorial, you will learn what **data leakage** is and how to prevent it. If you don't know how to prevent it, leakage will come up frequently, and it will ruin your models in subtle and dangerous ways.  So, this is one of the most important concepts for practicing data scientists.\n\n\n# Introduction\n\n**Data leakage** (or **leakage**) happens when your training data contains information about the target, but similar data will not be available when the model is used for prediction. This leads to high performance on the training set (and possibly even the validation data), but the model will perform poorly in production.\n\nIn other words, leakage causes a model to look accurate until you start making decisions with the model, and then the model becomes very inaccurate. \n\nThere are two main types of leakage: **target leakage** and **train-test contamination.**\n\n### Target leakage\n\n**Target leakage** occurs when your predictors include data that will not be available at the time you make predictions. It is important to think about target leakage in terms of the _timing or chronological order_ that data becomes available, not merely whether a feature helps make good predictions.\n\nAn example will be helpful. Imagine you want to predict who will get sick with pneumonia. The top few rows of your raw data look like this:\n\n| got_pneumonia | age | weight |  male | took_antibiotic_medicine | ... |\n|:-------------:|:---:|:------:|:-----:|:------------------------:|-----|\n|     False     |  65 |   100  | False |           False          | ... |\n|     False     |  72 |   130  |  True |           False          | ... |\n|      True     |  58 |   100  | False |           True           | ... |\n\nPeople take antibiotic medicines *after* getting pneumonia in order to recover. The raw data shows a strong relationship between those columns, but `took_antibiotic_medicine` is frequently changed _after_ the value for `got_pneumonia` is determined. This is target leakage.\n\nThe model would see that anyone who has a value of `False` for `took_antibiotic_medicine` didn't have pneumonia. Since validation data comes from the same source as training data, the pattern will repeat itself in validation, and the model will have great validation (or cross-validation) scores. \n\nBut the model will be very inaccurate when subsequently deployed in the real world, because even patients who will get pneumonia won't have received antibiotics yet when we need to make predictions about their future health.\n\nTo prevent this type of data leakage, any variable updated (or created) after the target value is realized should be excluded. \n\n![tut7_leakydata](https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/learn/images/y7hfTYe.png)"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":"### Train-Test Contamination\n\nA different type of leak occurs when you aren't careful to distinguish training data from validation data.  \n\nRecall that validation is meant to be a measure of how the model does on data that it hasn't considered before.  You can corrupt this process in subtle ways if the validation data affects the preprocessing behavior.  This is sometimes called **train-test contamination**. \n\nFor example, imagine you run preprocessing (like fitting an imputer for missing values) before calling [`train_test_split()`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split.html).  The end result?  Your model may get good validation scores, giving you great confidence in it, but perform poorly when you deploy it to make decisions.\n\nAfter all, you incorporated data from the validation or test data into how you make predictions, so the may do well on that particular data even if it can't generalize to new data. This problem becomes even more subtle (and more dangerous) when you do more complex feature engineering.\n\nIf your validation is based on a simple train-test split, exclude the validation data from any type of *fitting*, including the fitting of preprocessing steps.  This is easier if you use scikit-learn pipelines.  When using cross-validation, it's even more critical that you do your preprocessing inside the pipeline!\n\n# Example\n\nIn this example, you will learn one way to detect and remove target leakage.\n\nWe will use a dataset about credit card applications and skip the basic data set-up code.  The end result is that information about each credit card application is stored in a DataFrame `X`.

The variables **`active`** and **`majorcards`** are a little less clear, but from the description, they sound concerning.  In most situations, it's better to be safe than sorry if you can't track down the people who created the data to find out more.\n\nWe would run a model without target leakage as follows:"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":"# Drop leaky predictors from dataset\npotential_leaks = ['expenditure', 'share', 'active', 'majorcards']\nX2 = X.drop(potential_leaks, axis=1)\n\n# Evaluate the model with leaky predictors removed\ncv_scores = cross_val_score(my_pipeline, X2, y, \n                            cv=5,\n                            scoring='accuracy')\n\nprint(\"Cross-val accuracy: %f\" % cv_scores.mean())"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":"This accuracy is quite a bit lower, which might be disappointing.

Careful separation of training and validation data can prevent train-test contamination, and pipelines can help implement this separation.  Likewise, a combination of caution, common sense, and data exploration can help identify target leakage.\n\n# What's next?\n\nThis may still seem abstract.
