    "\n",
    "This is the first assignment in the Math for Machine Learning and Data Science specialization! Let's quickly go over how it works.\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment has $3$ graded functions. Each graded function will have some parts replaced as `None`. These parts you have to replace with the proper value. For instance, in the first graded function there is this line of code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "pivot_candidate = M[None, None]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that you must replace the correct values for the row (first None) and column (second None). Do not worry, the functions have comments on every line of code so you won't get lost! \n",
    "\n",
    "After each graded function, there is a code to test your solution. It will test your function with some basic and quick tests to assure you are in the right path! **Note that these tests perform only basic tests, so you may pass in the unit tests but fail when submitting your code.** This is because when grading we perform more complex tests. However, in any case you will be provided with feedbacks so it will help you debugging your code.\n",

    "### 1.2 Gaussian Elimination Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Gaussian elimination offers a systematic approach to solving systems of linear equations by transforming an augmented matrix into row-echelon form, thereby enabling the determination of variables. The algorithm comprises several essential steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE**: \n",
    "\n",
    "- For simplicity, the algorithm you will develop here will only work on **non-singular** systems of equations, i.e., equations that have a unique solution.\n",
    "- Remember you can check if a matrix is singular or not by computing its determinant.\n",

    "Initiate row operations to convert the augmented matrix into row-echelon form. The objective is to introduce zeros below the leading diagonal.\n",
